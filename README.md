4. Now copy the path of that folder and put it somewhere (Notepad or notepadqq)
5. Then go back to the scoop folder and open shims
6. make a new file and name it "bypass.cmd"
7. Open the file and type without parentheses (@"THE_COPIED_PATH.py"  %*)
8. Then save the file and open terminal and type "bypass" (Or whatever the .cmd is named) you should see the game
if not try again or make an issue
