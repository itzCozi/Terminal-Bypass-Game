# The login program will read groups of passwords from this file and
  pick one at random. It ignores any lines until the first blank line,
  and then reads all passwords as one group until another blank line
  or the end of the file is found.
# Make sure there is exactly one blank line before EVERY group of
  passwords, including the first group.
